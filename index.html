    <h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
    <p>I am a Software Test Engineer married to a Software Developer in Alexandria Virginia.  We lead an active lifestyle with two crazy French bulldogs.  I love to travel,
    run, and do sprint triathlons with my friends.</p>

    <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
    <p>As a tester it is important to be able to understand the software that I am working with.  It helps me to better communicate with my developers.</p>

    <h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
    <p>Ten + years ago I worked as a C++ and Java developer.  Over the past 10 years I have taken many courses, including courses in C, Java, Perl, Javascript, XML/XSLT, and HTML/CSS.</p>

    <h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
    <p>I will be working on a Mac for the most part.  I like to try out websites on a PC as well to make sure it behaves as expected.</p>

    <h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
    <p>Due to looming financial constraints, I am also taking CSCI E-34 <em>User Experience Engineering</em> to try and finish up my Web Technologies certificate before the end of the year.
      This is going to be very tough with my workload, but I will try my best to keep up.</p>
